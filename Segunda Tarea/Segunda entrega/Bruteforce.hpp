  /**
   * @brief Recursive procedure to find the best solution to JosephÂ´s problem
   * using brute force (Pure exhaustive search)
   * @param cookieIndex size_t with the index of the current cookie on the
   * cookies vector to be packed
   * @param cookies vector of @a cookieT with the cookies to pack, each index
   * on the vector should represent a single cookie with its type. The order of
   * the vector is irrelevant
   * @param currentSolution reference to a list of vectors of @a cookieT, where
   * each vector represents a packet. This param is used to temporarily store
   * each solution, build them and move through them
   * @param bestSolution reference to a list of vectors of @a cookieT, where
   * each vector represents a packet. This param is used to store the best
   * solution found and when calling this procedure for the first time, it MUST
   * be EMPTY
   * @param bestNetGain reference to an int where the net gain of the best
   * solution found will be stored, if no solution was found, it wont be modified
   * @param bestVar reference to a double where the variance of the best
   * solution found will be stored, if no solution was found, it wont be modified
   * @param packetPrice int with the sale price of each cookie packet
   * @param packetCapacity size_t with the max number of cookies that fit on
   * each packet
   * @param cookieCosts vector representing the production cost of each type of
   * cookie, where index = cookie type
   * @param cookieAmounts vector representing the number of cookies of each type
   * that were baked, where index = cookie type
   * @remark This procedure should not be used directly, the user should rather
   * call @a void bruteForce() which will make use of this procedure to work
